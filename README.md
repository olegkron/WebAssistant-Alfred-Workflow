# WebAssistant â€“ An Alfred workflow for web search with customizable fallback sites.

### Features: 
- #### Easy to add preferred searches
  The workflow is very simple which makes it easy to adjust to one's needs.
- #### Unlike many bookmark & search workflows, adds a fallback website on an empty query.
  For example: `yt cats` searches Youtube for *cats*, `yt` alone opens youtube.com.
- #### Customizable fallbacks
  For example: set `yt` with no query to open *youtube.com/subscriptions* instead of *youtube.com* homepage

> **Conflicts with existing Alfred workflow**  
Some sites used in this workflow are also used in the original Alfred "Web Searches" feature, so to not have duplicates in alfred suggestions, you'd have to remove these sites from either one of the workflows.
